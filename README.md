# EcoSystem

## C# Unity Scripts Project.

Only the scripts are being kept public


### Basis of Game
Generated animals have a thirst / hunger component to them.
To drink they must find the nearest water source.
To eat, they must wait for apples to drop from a tree.

If an animal still survives after 100,000 frames, they will reproduce. 

If an animal's hunger or thirst reaches 100%, they will vanish.

### Futures
I want to add foxes, birds and other animals that impact ecosystem.
